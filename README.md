Lab 5: Data Quality and Validation
In this lab, students will explore techniques for assessing and improving data quality. The lab focuses on two powerful tools:

Great Expectations – A data validation framework that helps ensure data integrity and consistency.
Cleanlab – A tool for detecting and correcting mislabeled data to improve model performance.
By working through this lab, students will gain hands-on experience in identifying data issues and enhancing dataset reliability, which are critical steps in any data science or machine learning workflow.
